# AI Insightr: Web Content Assistant

**Interact with web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, and Reddit posts using AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, right within your browser. Choose between direct API chat via a side panel or quick actions using the platforms' web UIs.**

---

This extension allows you to utilize various AI models to analyze and interact with content you encounter online. It provides two primary methods of interaction: a side panel for direct API communication and a popup/context menu for interaction via the AI platforms' standard web interfaces.

## Supported Platforms

AI Insightr can connect to the following AI platforms:

*   Gemini (Google)
*   ChatGPT (OpenAI)
*   Claude (Anthropic)
*   DeepSeek
*   Grok (xAI)
*   Mistral

Both API access (for the Side Panel) and Web UI interaction (for Popup/Context Menu) are supported for these platforms.

## Core Functionality

*   **Analyze Diverse Content:** Extracts relevant information from standard web pages (articles, blogs), YouTube video transcripts (when available), Reddit posts & comments, and the text content of PDF documents.
*   **Flexible Interaction Modes:**
    *   **Side Panel (API Mode):** Open a persistent panel alongside your content for direct chat conversations using the selected platform's API. This mode maintains chat history per tab and provides estimated token usage/cost tracking. *Requires configuring API keys in the extension's settings.*
    *   **Popup (Web UI Mode):** Use the extension's popup to quickly send the current page's extracted content and your prompt to the chosen AI platform's official website in a new tab. The extension attempts to automatically paste the content and prompt into the site's input field. *Does not require API keys for interaction.*
    *   **Context Menu (Web UI Mode):** Right-click on a page and select 'Process in Web UI' to instantly send the extracted content using your pre-defined default prompt for that content type to your preferred platform's website (similar to the Popup flow). *Does not require API keys.*
*   **Prompt Management:** Create, save, and organize custom prompts tailored for different content types (Web Page, YouTube, PDF, Reddit). These prompts are accessible from both the Popup and Side Panel. Manage them in the "Prompts" tab of the extension's Settings page.
*   **API Configuration (Side Panel Mode):** For users utilizing the Side Panel's API features:
    *   Securely store API keys obtained from AI providers within your browser's local storage.
    *   Fine-tune API request parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens, system prompt) for specific models via the Settings page ("API Settings" tab).
*   **UI Customization:** Adapt the Side Panel and Settings interface with Light/Dark themes and adjustable text sizes using controls in the header.

## Usage Overview

1.  **Install** the extension and pin it to your toolbar for easy access.
2.  **Choose your interaction method:**
    *   **For Quick Actions (Web UI):** Click the extension icon (Popup) or right-click the page (Context Menu). Select a platform, enter/select a prompt (popup only for custom prompt entry), and send. This opens the platform's website. Ensure you are logged into the respective platform's website in your browser.
    *   **For Direct Chat (API):**
        *   First, open the extension's **Settings** page (Options) and navigate to **API Settings**. Enter and save your API key(s) for the platforms you wish to use in the Side Panel.
        *   Open the **Side Panel** (via the icon in the popup or right-click context menu).
        *   Select the desired AI Platform and Model (only platforms with saved keys are available).
        *   Type your prompt or select a saved one. Toggle content extraction for the first message if needed. Chat directly within the panel.

## Usage Tips

*   **Inputting Prompts:** Press **Enter** to send your message. To add a new line without sending, use **Shift+Enter**.
*   **Loading Dynamic Content:** For YouTube/Reddit comments, scroll down the page first to ensure comments are loaded in the browser before using the extension if you want them included in the extracted content.

## Usage Notes

*   **Content Extraction:** The extraction process works well for standard web layouts, YouTube transcripts (if provided by the creator), Reddit posts/comments, and searchable PDFs. Complex or non-standard page structures might yield incomplete results.
*   **Popup/Context Menu (Web UI) Reliability:** The function that automatically pastes content into AI platform websites depends on their specific web interface structure. Updates to these websites (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) can temporarily break this feature. Updates to the extension will be released to address such changes when possible.
*   **Token Estimation (Side Panel API Mode):** Token counts and cost estimations displayed in the Side Panel are based on the `gpt-tokenizer` library. While generally accurate for OpenAI models, estimates for other platforms may differ from official billing due to varying tokenization methods. Always refer to the AI provider's dashboard for definitive usage data.
