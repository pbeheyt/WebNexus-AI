Choose the interaction mode that best suits your needs:

**1. Quick Actions via Popup (Uses Web UIs - No API Key Needed)**

*   **Best for:** Quickly summarizing or analyzing content using the official AI websites without needing API keys.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  Navigate to the web page, PDF, YouTube video, or Reddit post you want to analyze.
    2.  Click the **Nexus AI extension icon** in your toolbar to open the popup.
    3.  **Select an AI platform** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).
        *   *Note: Ensure you are logged into the selected platform's website in your browser.*
    4.  **Type a custom prompt** in the input box, or select a pre-saved prompt using the 'P' button.
    5.  Press **Enter** to send.
    6.  Nexus AI extracts the page content and opens the platform's official website in a new tab, automatically pasting your prompt and the extracted content.

**2. Direct Chat via Side Panel (Requires API Keys)**

*   **Best for:** In-depth conversations about page content, maintaining chat history per tab, using specific models, and tracking usage.
*   **Setup (One-time per platform):**
    1.  Click the Nexus AI extension icon, then click the **Side Panel icon** in the popup header to open the Side Panel.
    2.  Open the extension's **Settings** page (via the gear icon in the popup or by right-clicking the extension icon > Options).
    3.  Navigate to the **API Settings** tab.
    4.  Select the AI platform you want to configure (e.g., OpenAI for ChatGPT).
    5.  Follow the links provided (API Documentation/Console) to generate an API key on the platform's official website.
    6.  Copy the generated API key.
    7.  Paste the key into the API Key field in the extension's settings for that platform and click **Save Key**. The platform should now show a green checkmark in the Side Panel list.
    8.  *(Optional)* Configure advanced parameters (temperature, max tokens, system prompt) for specific models in the Advanced Settings section.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Open the **Side Panel** next to the content you want to discuss (using the Side Panel icon in the popup).
    2.  The Side Panel will open. Select your desired **AI platform and Model** from the dropdowns at the top.
    3.  **Type your prompt** in the input box at the bottom, or select a saved prompt using the 'P' button.
    4.  **Toggle Content Extraction:** Use the "Extract content" toggle below the welcome message (when the chat is empty) to control whether the current page's content is automatically included with your *first* message in a new chat session for that tab.
    5.  Press **Enter** to send your message. The AI response will appear directly in the Side Panel.
    6.  **Switch Models Mid-Chat:** You can change the selected model using the dropdown at the top of the Side Panel at any time during your conversation. Your chat history for the current tab will be preserved.
    7.  **Restart Conversation:** Click the **Refresh Chat** in the Side Panel header at any time to clear the current chat history and token counts for that tab, allowing you to start a fresh conversation.
*   **Side Panel Benefits:**
    *   Leverage **free API usage options** available from platforms like Gemini and Mistral.
    *   Maintains conversation history per tab.
    *   Tracks token usage and estimates costs.

## Usage Tips

*   **Inputting Prompts:** When typing in the prompt input box (in either Popup or Side Panel), press **Enter** to send your message. To add a new line without sending, use **Shift+Enter**.
*   **Loading YouTube/Reddit Comments:** If you want comments from YouTube videos or Reddit posts to be included in the extracted content, ensure you scroll down the page first to load them in your browser before using the extension.

## Usage Notes

*   **Web Page Extraction Reliability:** The strategy used for extracting content from general web pages works well for most standard layouts but may occasionally fail to capture content accurately on pages with very complex or non-standard HTML structures.
*   **YouTube Transcript Unavailability:** If a YouTube video does not have a transcript available, the extension cannot extract the spoken content. In these cases, only the video's metadata (title, description) and any loaded comments will be included in the extracted content sent to the AI.
*   **Platform Website Updates (Popup Mode):** AI platform websites (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) sometimes update their interface. Such updates can temporarily break the automatic copy-and-paste feature used by the **Popup** mode. We actively monitor these platforms and aim to release extension updates promptly to restore compatibility when breaks occur.
*   **Token Estimation Accuracy (Side Panel):** The Side Panel displays *estimated* token counts and potential costs based on the `gpt-tokenizer` library (`cl100k_base` encoding). While generally accurate for OpenAI models, estimates for other platforms (like Claude) might differ from actual billed usage by roughly Â±20% due to different tokenization methods. Always refer to the official platform dashboards for definitive usage and billing information. The estimates are provided for guidance only. (Expand the token counter section in the Side Panel for a detailed note.)
