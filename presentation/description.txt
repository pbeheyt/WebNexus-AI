# AI Insightr: Web Content Assistant

**Interact with web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, and Reddit posts using AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, and Mistral, right within your browser. Choose between direct API chat via the Side Panel or quick actions using the platforms' web UIs via the Popup/Context Menu.**

---

This extension leverages various AI models to analyze and interact with online content. It offers two distinct methods:

1.  **Side Panel (API Mode):** A persistent panel alongside your content for direct chat conversations using the selected platform's official API. Requires API key configuration in Settings.
2.  **Popup/Context Menu (Web UI Mode):** Quick actions to send extracted content and prompts to the AI platform's website in a new tab. Does *not* use API keys for the interaction itself but requires you to be logged into the respective platform's website.

## Supported Platforms

AI Insightr supports interaction with the following AI platforms:

*   Gemini (Google)
*   ChatGPT (OpenAI)
*   Claude (Anthropic)
*   DeepSeek
*   Grok (xAI)
*   Mistral

Both API access (Side Panel) and Web UI interaction (Popup/Context Menu) are supported for these platforms.

## Core Functionality

*   **Analyze Diverse Content:** Extracts key information from standard web pages, YouTube video transcripts, Reddit posts & comments, and PDF documents.
*   **Side Panel (API Mode):**
    *   Direct chat with AI models via API.
    *   Requires API key configuration in **Settings > API Settings**.
    *   Select specific AI platforms and models.
    *   Maintains separate conversation history per browser tab.
    *   Provides estimated token usage and API cost tracking (based on `gpt-tokenizer`, may differ from official billing).
    *   Supports system prompts (where applicable by the model).
    *   Toggle to include/exclude page content on the first message.
*   **Popup & Context Menu (Web UI Mode):**
    *   Send content and prompts to the AI platform's *website*.
    *   **Popup:** Select platform, enter/select prompt, toggle context inclusion.
    *   **Context Menu:** Right-click page -> "Process in Web UI (Default Prompt)" sends content with the default prompt for that content type to your preferred platform.
    *   Does *not* require API keys for interaction (relies on website login).
    *   Attempts to auto-fill the platform's website input.
*   **Prompt Management:** Create, save, edit, delete, and set default prompts for different content types via **Settings > Prompts**. Prompts are accessible in both Sidebar and Popup.
*   **API Configuration (for Side Panel):** Securely store API keys and fine-tune parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.) per model in **Settings > API Settings**.
*   **UI Customization:** Light/Dark themes and adjustable text sizes (Small, Base, Large) available in headers.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    *   `Alt+I` (or configured key): Open Popup.
    *   `Alt+U` (or configured key): Process page with default prompt via Web UI (like Context Menu).

## Usage Overview

1.  **Install** and pin the extension.
2.  **(For Side Panel - Recommended):** Open **Settings > API Settings**. Enter and save API keys for platforms you want to use in the Sidebar.
3.  **Choose Interaction:**
    *   **Popup (Web UI):** Click extension icon, select platform, write/select prompt, toggle context, click send. Opens platform website.
    *   **Context Menu (Web UI):** Right-click page, select "Process in Web UI...". Opens platform website with default prompt/content.
    *   **Side Panel (API):** Toggle via Popup icon or context menu. Select platform/model (API key required), chat directly.

## Usage Notes

*   **Content Extraction:** Works best on standard layouts. Complex sites or dynamic content (like comments loaded by scrolling) might require user action (scrolling) before extraction for completeness.
*   **Web UI Automation (Popup/Context Menu):** Auto-filling depends on the AI platform's website structure and may break if the site changes. Extension updates will aim to fix this.
*   **Token Estimation (Side Panel):** Estimates are based on `gpt-tokenizer` and may differ from official provider billing. Use provider dashboards for accurate cost/usage.
